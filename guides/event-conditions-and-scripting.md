## Intro

### How events are made
Events are stored in Content\Data\Event\(room_name).xnb, to learn more about what to do with xnb files please check [creating an XNB mod](creating-an-xnb-mod) because we will not be covering that here.

When you extract one of the xnb files you instead get a .yaml you can edit in, for example, Notepad++.
When opened you'll see alot of information, but the important part(s) are all under the ```content:  #!Dictionary<String,String>```.
